In the context of a science education grant titled “Dissemination of Scientific Teaching through Summer Institutes” from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Dr. Mark Graham (Director of Evaluation and Research at the Yale Center for Scientific Teaching) and Dr. Oriana Aragon (Postdoctoral Associate in research and evaluation at the Yale Center for Scientific Teaching), are conducting this evaluation to obtain information about the efficacy of the Summer Institutes. There is no monetary remuneration for participating in this evaluation.

 

The results of this survey will be used to produce evaluation reports. The aggregated results from data collection may appear in published papers, presentations, and other products. You can decline participation in an evaluation activity at any time without penalty. Although the evaluation will not benefit you personally, we hope that our results will contribute to the improvement of science education at America’s colleges and universities.

 

All your responses will be held in confidence. Only the researchers involved in the evaluation and those responsible for research oversight will have access to the information you provide. If not anonymous, your responses will be numbered, and the code linking your number with your name will be securely stored. Though unlikely, please note that the investigator can be compelled by a court to disclose this information if the data would have value in court proceedings.

 

If you have any questions about this study, you may contact the evaluation director, Dr. Mark Graham, at mark.graham@yale.edu, (203) 432-0576 or Dr. Oriana Aragon oriana.aragon@yale.edu.

Some colleagues are supportive, while others are resentful. Not all students feel comfortable in team setting. Sometimes, the pace doesn't fit everyones style. Thus, some students in the team setting may still be confused, because they need more time to process information. These are the ones I try to identify to help them out. I could see a transformation in my classroom, from the beginning of the semester toward the end. In the beginning students are quiet and reserved, and over time they do open up and start asking questions. Also, the types of questions they are asking improve. I'm hearing less of ""is this going to be on the exam"" and more of ""If a ____ doesn't work, will it cause ____ "".",1,,1,2,3,4,2,1,2,1,2,100,85,69,100,69,79,76,76,50,50,7,7,5,1,4,8,3,9,10,6,2,"reflective, self-critical, objective",5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,3,4,5,7,5,6,5,4,4,7,4,7,5,5,5,7,5,5,7,7,7,4,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,Biological Sciences,"AAAS, ASM, ASPB",6,2,2,2,,54,3,,2,,"Although I cannot state that SI changed my life by exposing me to the teaching methods I have been implementing in my classrooms, it definitely made transition easier. In addition, continued work of SI is slowly increasing the population of educators who are embracing backward design, are ""flipping the classroom"" and are focusing on what works better with students. The changes in society are often slow in coming. Education in most societies is an orphan that rarely gets the prime seat. Hence,one has to be patient. I am hopeful, that the trend will continue. Having engaged classroom that will be effective and not just entertaining, is difficult. It requires continued support, mentoring, time to reflect and assess. I hope that we, as a society, will persevere in this effort. "

I am very well aware of the differences in cultures among my students but I find it easier to treat everyone with the same high standards no matter how old or culture they come from. I do not believe in classifying people in races, americans just need to place people in boxes so that they can make sense of differences.  What about a revolutionary idea, that we are all Homo sapiens and we are all different from each other??? Embrace the differences and live in peace.

 I am not questioning your choice of question for I know that in this culture these questions have to be asked (not sure why?). If I were ever given a choice I would prefer to be in the underrepresented group of people with blue skin and fluorescent dots, like an avatar. Sorry this was a long survey. Have a great day!","Long survey but worth the time. I attended the Si for the first time in 2006 and since then I have seen the ideas flourish and the community grow. Keep growing and spreading the news. I am honored to be a part of the process, it has momentum right now...."

I don't find the 'active learning' teaching method of greater value than many other teaching methods and, thus, have hardly changed how I run the classes.

I've always provided my students clear learning points and find it silly that the SI community thinks 'active learning' is the only way such can be accomplished.

I suspect that 'active learning' is a good change for poorly performing educators to transition to, because it is better to have the students teach themselves than an incompetent teacher.  In many cases, a talented educator can more efficiently use class time other ways to accomplish the same end."

I believe inclusiveness is an important goal, but I didn't find the SI that helpful in promoting it. There are many questions in this survey that ask for specific answers when the best answer would be more equivocal. Multiple choice questions have their limits for us, not just for students.

There is some effectiveness as a teacher that comes not from whether it is active or passive, but something more subjective. Excitement and a belief in ones students can go along way in making them become the active learner even when the material is in a lecture format. "

For instance, many introductory courses are 2-4 linked semesters. I've seen the differences between instruction and assessment, which can lead to difficulties for students moving between courses. Additionally, many of the goals of SI are best thought of programmatically, rather than course by course. This isn't to say that we can't effect change in students in a single course, but things like metacognition, inclusivity, and recognition/appreciation for diversity aren't particularly impactful (IMO) if they drop in and out of teaching from the student's perspective. Not a problem with SI, but just an issue I see limiting the impact in some cases.

I also find it makes me a more confident teacher since I am called upon to improvise regularly when trying to engage the class. Students (some) are more comfortable being wrong on occasion. I'd also say that in-class activities are a great way to model exam questions and expectations, so students are better prepared for a range of question types.

It was nice to be, for a brief time, part of a community excited about thinking through teaching. 

I did not feel that the community extended past the SI meeting, nor do I feel any particular support by being part of the greater community, even when I interact with people from SI at other meetings. I'm sure it has turned into a larger community for some participants, though, which I'm sure is helpful for those who are in less than supportive environments. "

Many studies come to conclusions, that I believe, do not apply to the students in my institution.  Yet, much research into educational practices tend to purport that such practices work everywhere.  Also, I think it is more realistic to present the impact/costs of educational reform (psychological, professional, content, loss of some students at the top and bottom ends).  For example, I think there should be a specific SI presentation on the depressing effect it can have on educators and students when you assess difficult objectives and deeply held misconceptions.  Data should be offered for comparison with students at similar levels, institutions, and classes. 

I am bothered that this survey did not ask at all whether educators implementing the SI lessons measured the effectiveness with their students.  This is key to scientific teaching, but it was not mentioned here at all.

Also, the implications of the survey (based on question choice) is that 100% interactive, 24/7 is the only acceptable mix.  There is a place for lecture.  Lecture can engage to students with real-world applications, stories, and projects.  It can provide careful explanation of the difficult topics that students could not arrive at on their own.  It is off-putting to faculty newly introduced to scientific teaching to pretend that this means completely throwing out old knowledge and skills.  "

The SI allowed us to reflect on our teaching and consider how to not only incorporate new ideas but also how to facilitate that incorporation based on years of experience with students.

Metacognition and student reflection on their education helps.  In presenting students with Bloom's taxonomy as well as explaining to them the purpose of activities (eg. explaining why they do writing assignments instead of just assigning and collecting them), helps students understand that education is not just a formless collection of activities, assignments, and grades that the professors make up.  They seem to enjoy the courses more.

Regarding the Census Survey- the questions on self-esteem were annoying."

In other words, these students much prefer to work independently and think group work slows them down or requires too much accomodation.  This includes students at all range of abilities.   I'm not sure if this is because some of us instructors are not adjusting our strategies so they are more suitable for more advanced science students, particularly the seniors.","12,16,17,20,28,30",4,I think there is a tremendous benefit for training my graduate teaching assistants to be better instructors and to consider teaching with me to be a valuable professional development opportunity.

Engaging national leaders and prominent scientific societies gave it special visibility and promoted acceptance from the beginning.  The UW-Wisconsin and Yale groups have been superb in instilling the SI with rigor and creativity.  It's major role has been a highly successful national movement that has been widely disseminated. 

I think the next step is to figure out how to maintain the movement so it is really embraced by many more tenure track faculty. At my institution, the lecturers are rewarded for their efforts in scientific teaching and get tremendous press ""for the department"", but it hasn't really been integrated into what the majority of us tenure track faculty do as regular practice.  I think there are still prevailing attitudes of great researcher VERSUS great teachers that persist.   Maybe there should be an SI to convert departmental chairs at research intensive universities??"

Designing the teachable tidbit was more an exercise in the frustration of working with people who had never used active learning before and didn't really get on board with the purpose of it, than it was of building a piece of curriculum.

Overall it was a good experience. But I also want to tell you that I think that changing one small piece of curriculum does not address the underlying ""problem."" That is, that lecture-centered, instructor-centered, knowledge-delivery instructors have a fundamentally different idea of their own and their students' roles in a science classroom than do people like me. I see students as co-creators of, and collaborators in working with, scientific knowledge in a classroom that is (should be) designed to introduce them to an authentic (sensu Dunabr 2000) experience of scientific enterprises - NOT just ""the scientific process"" (as if there IS one). It is by evaluating and fundamentally altering our roles as instructors that we learn to create meaning in our classrooms, which then drive us finding and choosing concepts and scientific practices that support working with knowledge to build meaning and to explain the natural world."

These things gave me the confidence and the credentials to act as an agent for change in science education in my department and university.  My focus on education is so far being rewarded by my department and college.  My only remaining fear is that the old science/biology curriculum - lots of facts without an emphasis on core concepts or competencies - will stiffle real change in teaching because if the point is to deliver lots of information, then active teaching becomes somewhat forced and less effective.  This remains a huge barrier to change (sorry if I left that out of the earlier section)."

Half the time, we didn't know what was being asked.  As a presenter, one year my session was not evaluated and the participants were upset that they were not given the opportunity to comment on it.

Overall, however, I think this has been a great effort and I have very much enjoyed interacting with participants and local organizers."

But this Fall, Things are looking up. One off the best things I learned about Students  (NOT THROUGH THE SI), is to know the name of each student. I makes a BIG difference.

Several dominant personalities from the same school kind of took over and they were not inclusive.  Our group was short a facilitator and the facilitator we had seemed to sanction the behavior.  The non inclusiveness continued after the SI when it came time to prepare our tidbit for submission to Coursesource.  The experience made me want to be more effective in group settings, so I can more effectively promote inclusive practices.  So, at the SI I had a learning experience that was not expected, but it was an important lesson for me.  I am very grateful that the SI folks looked kindly on our application and allowed us to come.  I felt sad when I was not asked back to be a facilitator.  I wish the SI as I know it, would continue.  In understand that it will end in 2015.  "

My evaluations have continued to go up each semester, and when I went to a flipped classroom with most of the class time devoted to active learning, I got by far the highest evaluation scores I've ever received.  
Student evaluations of what they are learning and the impact of the course structure on their learning are very favorable - they see the value of what we do in class and report that they better understand the material, what they are supposed to be learning (skills and content), their responsibilities in the course, and how to learn and apply the material better as a result of the course structure than when they are in lecture classes.",2,"my university's iTeach program, participation in an on-campus faculty learning community focused on flipped classroom and active learning",1,4,5,5,5,1,2,1,1,100,75,100,100,100,75,25,38,75,75,7,1,8,2,3,9,5,10,7,4,6,,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,7,7,7,4,7,7,2,6,4,7,3,3,6,2,7,7,7,5,2,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,Biology and Wildlife,"AAAS

I strongly believe that SI would have more impact in the long run if they push young starting professors or even postdocs to participate. There are changes I couldn't push through in my class because I was co-teaching with senior professors. They simply do not want to put in extra effort if they've already got their system going.

I requested the change because after the summer institute and the CREATE workshop, I was convinced that our teaching approach was deadly in the large courses.  I had used clickers before the SI but I could not get buy-in from the lab coordinators.  I am much happier having switched to smaller courses where I can do interactive teaching all the time.  I am not where I want to be yet but I learn each semester how to improve and I teach a remedial, a sernior elective and a graduate course in PSM in Biotech so the landscape is different for each.  I learned a lot during the SI and still use the case study we developed.  Thanks to all who were part of developing the SI."

Excited by the doors that opened to me and my colleague by attending the NANSI 2014. Returned t our department and shared our experience at our annual day-long retreat. Well received by colleagues. Now pushing to revamp our first year experience for Biol majors, empowered by the NANSI experience and our department's commitment to HHMI's SEA-PHAGE (in our 4th year but only for some of our 1st year majors). Hope to submit proposal to our Administration soon. Our vision is to expand our Intro sequence to 2 full semester of workshop (studio) format interweaving lecture and lab with inquiry-based experiences ala Phage Hunters for 1st semester (until we can design our own) and new field experiences for our second semester. We plan to use Malcolm Campbell's exciting new e-text.
Thank you all for providing this stimulating workshop. "

Although I often have visitors from other colleges and universities observing my class and discussing how to implement active learning, my own peers seem indifferent. I have tried several workshops throughout the years and the only ones who attend are the ones already implementing active learning or who say they agree with it. Although I knew the teaching strategies presented at SI prior to attending, I was thrilled that SI existed and that it was bringing professors together from across the nation. It is a great effort, but I believe in my professional opinion, that for it to be widely implemented, there needs to be a mentoring/coaching component involved. The culture of how we teach students at large universities must change. This is a push in the right direction, and I am very glad to be a part of it!"

First of all, you have to have a really good active learning exercise that will do exactly what you think it will do.  Then it has to be executed smoothly such that it doesn't bog down the flow of teaching and learning in the classroom.  Many times the exercise takes longer than anticipated, which can thrown off the course schedule.  Even if you use a well-crafted tidbit made by someone else you still have to adapt it for the unique circumstances of your own course so you can't just automatically pull the tidbit off the shelf and use as is.  On the other hand, it's not as difficult or cumbersome to incorporate small changes in your instruction like not lecturing all the time and punctuating your lectures with some active engagement with and by your students.

","Most of the coverage of scientific teaching was good, but I was quite disappointed with the segment on inclusive teaching.  I didn't learn any new strategies from this segment.  For our teachable units we needed to state how we were making them inclusive, and many of the groups said that they were being inclusive by making their powerpoints legible for colorblind people.  I thought this was a little snarky, and gave the false impression that inclusivity for folks with colorblindess is our major challenge increasing diversity in the sciences!  This section would have greatly benefited by being lead by some ACTUAL UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES, rather than some (very nice) white guys in their 50's."

I like that you remain in contact with Alumni and provide resources. Maybe have a follow-up summer institute to have alumni actually demonstrate their lectures and activities to other members of HHMI to get feedback and hone skills even more.  New participants would get a chance to see in action as well.  Do know if something like this would work but could be helpful.


I have really thought more  about my  teaching skills in  science and how I want to change and develop the things that I learned.  Teaching is extremely important and the learning be inclusive of the entire classroom to make science more accessible to actually learn.

Thank you!"

Although this course is designated as a ""lecture"" course, we did not give one single lecture -- the course was 100% active learning and teamwork-based. Without my experiences as first a participant and then as a facilitator at SI, I would not have had the confidence or the knowledge/skills/tools to develop a course like this one. I continue to modify and improve all of my courses each semester. In addition to the feedback I give my students, I ask for feedback from them throughout the course, thus making my teaching dynamic. My students continue to amaze me with the things they are capable of doing, and I have learned that the only way to find out what they can do is to challenge them in new and different ways."

I still felt good about being there and learning active learning techniques, but I did come to realize that my teaching style didn't really matter compared to teaching faculty that would reach many more students much more often during their career.

I was rejuvenated and encouraged to see how hard the participants had worked to implement their SI training. My only regret was that other faculty from the host institution (my home institution) did not attend the follow-up. All the attendees were from smaller colleges, which reinforced to me that teaching is not valued at my home institution as much as it is at smaller institutions. The experience was very valuable for my career, working with faculty across disciplines to improve their teaching methods. I'm able to use the research about scientific teaching to offer more foundation for the ideas I'm espousing. I enjoy being a ""guide on the side"" with other faculty to generate new ideas for their teaching. "

Also, data on effectiveness of SI is still a bit murky - as scientists we need to keep an objective approach. Does SI work any better than other methods? It can be different, but I'm not sure about creating better learners. How to measure effectiveness of classroom activities is problematic - i try, but still left with a feeling of, ""is it really making my students better learners?""

Unfortunately when this is not achieved, the classroom outcome is worse than giving a standard lecture. I think this is because students are very much used to a lecture format and so it is easier to give a acceptable lecture. Newer, innovative class activities that are not pitched at the correct level are received more poorly by students than a ""boring"" lecture. This is the major challenge I face."

I really felt reinvigorated to continue to evolve in my teaching both undergraduates and graduate students.  I incorporated the workshop into my professional development graduate course ""Seminar in University Teaching"" and it has been incredibly well-received and effective.  My ~75 student upper-level microbiology course (Pathogenic Bacteriology) is definitely more interactive now, as well as my 12-16 student upper-level laboratory course, in which the students are doing actual research (some of which will be published this Spring).  I truly appreciate the work that has gone into developing the SI and I hope it will continue to be available."

I was really surprised at how much I ""advanced"" on the road to active learning by attending the SI last summer. During the week, it felt overwhelming, especially in the construction of the tidbit in collaboration with the other members of the group. However, when I reconstructed my fall course, it came easily to me. The only problem was that I ran out of time to reinvent all the classes so had to default back to the old power points for the last few sessions. I am currently planning to convert my spring class to 50% active learning and the class for next fall to 75% active learning. At least now I know how much of a challenge this is. Going to 10% active learning on the first round of course conversion is a more likely scenario, but I'm sure I will get faster at converting a course once I have done it more. I co-presented a workshop on active learning in two sessions to a total of ~33 people this week."

Others brought cameras to class to take pictures of the questions and answers because occasionally these questions were redesigned for the exam.  Students weren't then engaged in thinking and working in groups, they were only interested in getting it right.  If there was more than one correct answer, with one answer being more correct than another, the students exhibited a fair amount of antagonism.  I couldn't understand it.  This was low stakes and was designed to help them understand the material.  It made them hostile and in return it made me feel defensive.  While this was true for about 20% of the class, they were a vocal group and could sometimes ""turn the tide of opinion"" which in large class can turn ugly.   I am still convinced that these are good exercises because the feedback was that these questions helped them 'understand what they didn't understand' before the test.  I think it was fear.  Nobody likes to see that they really in fact don't get something.  Another 10% just didn't participate because it was in fact low stakes, and just didn't care. With a large class, clickers were really the best way to implement scientific learning exercises.  What seemed to work, was to have a mix of clicker questions - some where students had to answer on their own, and others where they worked in groups and discussed.  When we had more time to discuss the answers and questions and feedback, that helped, but then we ran out of time to cover the core material.  I kept cutting material, but couldn't seem to find a good balance.   Still looking for that sweet spot.  In a different class, implemented JIT, with on-line quizzes covering required reading, where students could get immediate feedback on how they did on quiz before lecture each day, and could keep taking each days quiz as many times as they liked before the exam.  The students loved this.  The difficulty is, I had designed those questions, and homework questions already two different ways and then couldn't come up with a really different way to phrase and ""Bloom"" out the exam questions.  That meant if I wanted to have a good bloom distribution, the exam had plenty of nearly identical question repeats. Ack! The difficulty here was the first exam then had an 89% mean!   I had students crying and hugging me, one started to praise me in spanish after the exam. A few colleagues were raising their eyebrows at me, I was embarrassed.  Students were all saying - oh, take physiology from Prof. So and so, this class is so easy.  So,  its a learning process - can't do it perfectly the first time around!  After that, I worked on how I did the quiz questions and homework questions, and the second exam was more respectable  and reflective of actual student learning (and the students loved me less...).  ","1,2,7,9,11,14,16,17,18,20,22,24,28,29,30",4,"The previous box listed the difficulties of ""back-engineering"" two large science major lecture courses to become active learning.  Honestly, it was a slog and a very vocal portion of students just were not receptive.  Had I the luxury of time, and teaching assistants to completely redesign all lectures of all of those courses, I reckon it would be different.  I had been teaching those course the same way for 7 years prior to taking the SI course.  However,  I DID have the luxury, of building a brand new course using the scientific teaching principles of SI.   I LOVED IT!  I was able to cover the material without a lecture!  I did love the active environment, having groups of TAS (which I recruited from undergraduate TAs, and paid myself, via promised letters for med school).  It was invigorating!  Students really gave alot of positive feedback,  the first time I taught this course for non-majors I had an enrollment of 30 students, the second time the course was offered the enrollement shot up to 120!  This was just by word of mouth!  I utilized the Sci Amer. textbook,  built my learning goals and outcomes, then the syllabus, it just fell into place it was beautiful and I loved teaching again.  This is why it is hard for me to fill in the above. I had two diametrically opposed experienced.  One where I was able to use SI from the ground up, and another that involved back engineering really large classes for pre-meds (cell biology and physiology).  The students in the new class, really did teach each other.  It was an amazing and humbling experience.  I really got how great this experience could be.  Those two large majors classes were necessary for MCATs and so students were really upset if we did not get to ""core material""  because we were engaged in active learning. If I used actively learning in the classroom - they just fought and fought. In my non-majors class they loved it!  I loved it!  I wonder if I had been able to first introduce the majors class years ago as a ""new"" class if thing would have been different.  Expectations were already set. When the clicker exercises when well, the majors class just erupted in discussion and people were high fiving, and questions and new content would get addressed. Their would be great energy.  Even the ""sleepers"" would wake up and engage.  When it worked, it was great.

",6,3,3,2,,47,3,,2,,"A troubleshooting section or discussion board for SI alums would be great.  Lets acknowledge that like good science, scientific teaching does not work on the first or sometimes even the second trial. There will be mis-steps.  What works and doesn't work, best practices for clickers - and resources or databases for ""newbies"" to get their feet wet in terms of making a good clicker questions. If folks have a heavy teaching load, and are back engineering classes, more support,  databases, and access to other folks to get some real time feedback would be great.  Let's put some of those teaching principals into practice for the students (the faculty taking the course)!  Having the follow up meetings was good - but having them every year - or doing an NSF on-line style poster event ala IGERT might be a great follow up, and way to get folks involved if they can't travel to meeting and get a big involvement of stakeholders across the country."

Students who are accustomed to a certain kind of lecture course with a couple of multiple choice tests as the only assessments are resistant to other approaches, particularly if they think they will need to do more work.  Some students think that instructors are being lazy if they don't spend every minute lecturing.  It is not practical to change how someone else teaches, but it does affect what students expect in your classroom and in your exams.  

It is a challenge to implement some of these practices in my large enrollment classes.  I use clickers, think-pair-share and one minute papers, but I'm having a hard time getting more in-class activities going for 200 + students.  The design of the classroom does not make it easy to walk around among the students if I give them worksheets - it is a very crowded lecture hall with almost no room between the rows - so I have reluctantly concluded that worksheets/group work may not be feasible in these classes.

I would have liked more follow up help after attending the SI. Though I understand that this may be difficult to provide, it makes it much harder for novices to make changes.  Some things, like clickers, are pretty straightforward, but restructuring entire courses is hard and it would have been very helpful to have someone knowledgeable provide a little feedback, given that at many institutions there are no other resources in turn to.

I did notice a definite and positive difference in my classroom when I began using clickers and think-pair-share, and was very happy with the increased level of engagement.  That by itself is worth a lot.  But I don't know how to assess reliably how much of a difference it is making to the students' learning.  It would be nice to be able to defend these practices, given that my teaching evaluations have gone down somewhat since I implemented them.  ","5,10,11,12,13,16,17,28,30",4,"I think that I am more intentional about choosing what to teach and how to teach it.  I also focus more regularly on making sure that I am making the process of science more visible to students.  Also, though I have not entirely abandoned lectures, they are not the sole method, and they are broken up into smaller units, to allow for more active learning.  Students actually do seem to like clickers and the fact that they can talk to each other to figure out answers.  They are definitely more engaged and less passive.",1,,1,2,4,5,6,2,2,2,1,100,67,75,75,100,63,100,100,50,51,7,6,5,2,3,9,1,8,10,4,7,Honest/ truth-seeking : Between 2 and 3,5,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,4,5,7,1,2,3,7,7,4,7,3,7,7,4,3,3,7,7,6,5,7,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,3,2,Biochemistry,"ASBMB

For example, you ask about Bloom's taxonomy and whether the respondent had heard of it, used it etc, prior to attending the SI.  A person may not have heard of Bloom's taxonomy but may, nevertheless, have used the underlying principles before the SI.  If the answer chosen is no, it suggests that the respondent began using the principles after the SI, while in reality the only thing that changed for the respondent is knowing that it was described by Bloom.  For several such questions, it is possible that the answers chosen don't reflect what the respondent actually did before and after the SI."

",4,2,3,2,,66,3,,1,Woman,"I feel that the Summer Institute has little to do with improving science teaching but is a social science experiment.  I suspect the only important questions on this survey were the ones in the last half.  It seems extremely odd that the scholarly readings were mostly 8-10 years old and many findings had not held up with newer research.  Also, a large number of methods were presented so fast that no one could follow most of them and most of us had knowledge of most of them.  The vast amount of time was spent in poorly assigned small groups where we were supposed to generate a huge report about teaching a concept.  Our group was totally dominated by one African American female administrator that even intimidated the facilitator.  She berated me for leaving the room to handle some very important things with my husband and at work and was almost threatening to a junior faculty member form her own institution.  When I expressed concerns to the individuals from my institution that my group dumbed down the concept that was supposed to be for a junior level course to what we teach at the entry level, they all felt that the same thing happened with them.  One of the people from my institution said that they had gone out of their way in a group of physical chemists and physiologists to keep the concept simple.  This group was openly criticized for present material above the undergraduate level.  One of the staff who spent the entire conference making snide remarks about southern colleges and universities was exceptionally vocal about the level of math being to hard for biology majors.  My take away from the SI is that interactive learning in many cases as presented at the institute is a way of simplifying the level of material taught and that the dumbing down of undergraduate education is worse that I believe possible and worse than is reported in educational literature.  As I said in my exit survey, this was a total waste of my time."

My biggest obstacle using the methods I learned about is time. It took our entire group a whole week to come up with one tidbit; when one teaches as many courses as I do, plus all of the other responsibilities I have, just incorporating a few things in the course of the semester is challenging enough for me. I don't like to do things ""half well"" so get frustrated not being able to do it ""right"". So, I just do a few things well and don't worry about flipping my entire course.
