We discussed different learning styles in the pre-lab lecture for a laboratory course. During the lab, I explained an anticipated result for the control reactions to study electron transport to a student who was really struggling with understanding electron transport in general. I could see the student still had a confused look and asked which learning style he connected with during the lecture. Visual. ""Aha. I've been explaining this wrong,"" I said. Let's draw out what happens. The student started drawing what would happen in each of his experiments perfectly and showing his drawings to teammates to explain.

At the beginning of every Genetics lecture, I list the learning objectives for the day. At the end of the lecture, I repeat the list with sub-bulleted examples that were discussed or problems worked during class that were relevant to each objective, so that students could see how class activities were mapped to the objective. I initially told students that those objectives represented what I wanted them to be able to do at the end of the section/course, but they didn't appreciate these until I told them that when writing an exam, I start with the objectives, write a question that addresses one or more objective; and that the exam is done when all objectives have been checked off the list. I told them to look at the verbs in the objectives to know what I would ask them to do on an exam. At that point, students were more interested in the objectives. It was a reminder to me to be more transparent in how the objectives drive the course material.","One great thing about teaching a lab course is that student approaches to completing lab work are a great visual to elucidate the range of misconceptions students have about how a method works. In other words, they are excellent at showing you where your instructional activities have failed! For that reason, assignments in my lab course are under constant revision.

For example, to cover pollination syndromes, I don't go thru pictures of floral morphology and describe each pollinator type (the traditional approach), and instead use the publication as the basis but insert images along with the data to illustrate these syndromes.  This is a good way to lecture to a large class because it includes the process of science, critical thinking about the data, as well as the images, etc.","I am always tweaking my approaches away from traditional lecturing which causes the students' eyes to glaze over.  I try to just mix it up.  One example is that I try to teach an entire lecture on evolution without using the word until the very end so the students stay engaged instead of dismissing it because the topic is evolution.  I use the David Baum/Stacy Smith book on phylogenetics to show genealogical relationships in a phylogenetic framework because they all buy into that, and then related that back to common misconceptions in evolution.","What participants walk away with are the things they can do in intro classes.  I find it hard convincing faculty who only teach upper division classes that they also need to do this in their large lecture classes.  Nearly everyone does this in their upper division/small enrollment classes.  It's difficult to convince them that lecturing is ineffective and that they need to approach their large class just like a small class.  Some examples for upper division courses would be good (ecology, genetics, evolution, etc.).",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,19,1,1

So often I simply said the question and it was rhetorical because I would answer as soon as I asked the question, without giving the students to learn, think, and process.","The SI was a unique experience to learn how to teach and to learn how actual learning takes places with effective teaching; I truly learned a lot from my peer colleagues and the value of group work. Faculty may often complain how students learn and interact, but in many ways the faculty emulate the same behavior as their own students. To me, it is learning about human behavior and tuning our teaching to those behaviors so our students are in a better environment to learn. As a faculty, I have learned how to cultivate an effective learning environment, by attending the summer institute.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,19,0,0

We have 30 class periods worth of examples.,"The best example is when an international student asked why answer A below was not the correct answer.
What is the correct order of the processes responsible for the production of a protein, starting from a gene?
A) replication; transcription; translation (67.2%) (46.1%)(47.2%)(33.7%)
B) transcription; translation (21.5%) (41.1%)(44.2%)(52.1%)
C) translation; transcription (1.6%) (1.9%)(2%)(3.6%)
D) replication; translation; transcription (8.2%) (9.9%)(5.8%) (8.7%)
E) RNA  DNA  Protein (1.3%) (0.8%)(0.8%)(1.9%)

Upon explaining why A was the incorrect answer and B was the correct answer, he made the connection. We had similar issues to questions like this one in the past. So, I asked where and when did he learn that replication is necessary for gene expression? He pointed to the classroom. At that instant, I realized we teach and asses replication, transcription and translation in the same day, in the same chapter of the text and in same exam. The student combined all the processes into one concept and one purpose because we taught it that way. Since then, we have separated when we teach and assess replication and gene expression, and the results were as we expected. The percentages after each answer are the various semester we have asked this question on the exam. The first percentage is when we realized the issue and the percentages thereafter are when we modified the class material.",,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,19,0,0

I have used information form the news to start a discussion on evolution of the HIV virus. Students have to discuss the news and provide evolutionary scenarios about the evolution of the HIV virus in certain populations, name the pressures causing the changes in the allele frequencies within populations. One of the questions that students have to discuss is "" can we stop the evolution of the HIV virus"""".","I remember changing the examples in my lectures to include more diverse examples of different ethnic groups. For example when we discuss NURTURE versus NATURE in introductory biology classes, I now use the example of the OBAMA family and contrast it with another picture of an Irish immigrant family coming to the USA with no possessions. Then I allow students to discuss the role of Nature vs Nurture. Simple pictures have changed the discussion in class. Diversity had been the last topic that I have tried to incorporate into my lectures, mostly because I was not sure how to do it. Slowly I am incorporating more and more examples.","The Summer Institute was the greatest professional development experience that I have ever had. I was fortunate to be exposed to the ideas of Scientific Teaching and to meet such a dedicated and creative group of educators. The contacts that I made at the SI have led to an array of other opportunities such as joining SABER and NRMN. Now that we have approximately 6 interested SI Alumni in our department we finally have a critical mass to start some real institutional changes besides our own courses.  I forsee significant changes in our department in the next five years.

One was having them, in pairs, research and explain to the class how techniques used in the paper worked.  The second was having them read the introduction, but no further, to identify the questions addressed in the paper, then providing them with only the figures in the paper.  Working in groups they are asked to use the figure legends to understand the experimental design, and then examine the data and decide what they could conclude.  Finally, they are allowed to read the discussion. This helped them identify what evidence there was for each claim and to begin to see that the idea was to evaluate the evidence, not simply report what the authors had said.","The survey asks questions about teaching to include diverse points of view (different genders, races, ethnicities, etc.).

So when you asked whether or not I was teaching in the current semester, or if I will teach in the Spring semester, it was a difficult question to answer since I teach next in Winter Quarter (which seems to span both semesters).
I appreciated going through group work in the summer institute I attended since it reminded me of what the process is like for students and spurred me to find materials to aid them in their team formation and interactions. I also picked up a few activities that I could share with other instructors at my institute. I was already familiar with all of the theory that was shared. I also thought that if the theory is going to continue to be shared with participants, then those sessions should be more active and in line with the theories that we are lectured on.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,18,0,0

This semester I had such a small class that I could only have three teams, with ten organelles to discuss. My solution was to have three rounds in which each team had to choose an organelle that was not previously selected.

The students hold a grant panel, discuss the merits and potential issues of each proposal and then rank proposals for funding.  The added component to this exercise that increases connections between students and colleagues is that this 'think of the next experiment' is based on a paper written by a colleague in the department and that colleague attends the grant panel.  At the end of ranking the proposals, the colleague then provides information about which experiments they might actually have followed up with and gives feedback on experimental design.  It is a fun process for students and PIs alike!","I've found that it is challenging to introduce students to the pace of completing activities in class, especially for students that have dispensation to take time and a half on assessments. Rather than collecting materials the day that activities occur, I now allow all students the option to continue working on projects started in class and turn these in during the following class period.  Although some students do submit their work during the same class period, a number continue to work on the material, which then allows everyone to work for the amount of time they feel they need to do the assignment well.",I think one of the most valuable aspects of the Summer Institute was the expectation that faculty at different stages (junior and senior) attend.  This helped move the conversation about active learning out of individual classrooms and into faculty meetings (at least sometimes!) as well as increased the perceived validity of this approach at the departmental level.,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,17,0,0

In spring 2016, we all worked together to offer a pared-down version of the Institute to faculty at our institution--thirteen attended. Like the Summer Institute, we planned and presented the entire workshop using the principles of Scientific Teaching. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback from a group of faculty who are very research focused. The active presentation was very helpful to keep their interest and get them thinking in new ways about their own teaching.","When I first started teaching large lecture-based courses, it was very difficult to keep students' attention. I tried to solve this problem by asking questions in class using a classroom response system, but it didn't seem to help much. Over a few semesters, I have improved student engagement in a few ways: 1. writing questions that are more challenging or address misconceptions, 2. assigning pre-class homework to prime students for in-class learning, and 3. using a variety of strategies for asking questions and calling on students to give answers. I still have some trouble getting students to volunteer to answer questions out loud in class, so I'm working on that now.","Participating in the Summer Institute was a life-changing experience for me. For some time, I wanted to learn more about how to teach better, but I didn't know of many opportunities for professional development that went beyond an hour-long workshop here and there. Being able to work in a team to create a final, teachable product was a turning point in my development as a teacher. Now I find myself helping other faculty learn about teaching as well, which it very satisfying!",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,17,0,0

I simply cut up a diagram explain the two endosymbiosis events, so that in the end there was a cell with a nucleus, a cell with a nucleus + mitochondrion, and cell with a nucleus, miochondrion, and plastid. I colored the mitochondria purple and the plastids green. There was also a cyanobacterium (green) and a purple bacterium (purple). The set of images was completed by two plus signs and two equal signs. Students arrange the sequence and glue it down. I thought perhaps the color coding made things too easy, but I was surprised by how resistant they are to the idea that an animal-like cell came before a plant-like cell. Students routinely insist that they are missing some pictures or ignore the color coding and put the plant-like cell first. I follow the strip sequence with clicker questions about order of events. I find that students remember the theory MUCH better if they work it out for themselves. I used to just tell them the sequence, and almost every forgot it by test time.

Students do the problems using IF-AT forms in small groups. This promotes discussion and prevents students from simply waiting to hear the TA's answers. A few questions are always included that do not have IF-AT answers, so that each group of students can come up with their own answer and then compare their answer with that of other groups, rather than relying on the TA or instructor to provide an answer.  This is intended to mimic how science is done -- you confirm your answers by getting others to repeat the experiments, not by consulting a superior authority.","I think I was doing most of the procedures advocated by 'scientific teaching' before I went, but the Institute gave me the vocabulary to discuss it and reinforcement (& rationale) for doing it.

Each week, I create 6 prompts for active learning activities that they can tackle in small groups (4-5 students).  The prompts cover writing skills, first year seminar topics, logic problems, data interpretation, group projects, and occasionally hands on science (such as working with microscopes).  We cover the actual learning objectives for the day with complete transparency about why each is relevant.

I allow each group to work at their own pace with the requirement that they complete 5 activities for full points and have an instructor ""check-in"" before they leave.  I offer up a bonus point to everyone in the group if they can hit all 6.  This allows those who are learning quickly to leave early while those who struggle are able to obtain extra attention.  This format does require the use of strong TAs who can ""sign-off"" on activities, monitor stations with equipment (like microscopes), and who can answer the occasional question.","I teach a non-science majors course in environmental conservation.  We were covering the topic of human population and food security and I snagged an activity from a textbook that presented the carrying capacity for each country in a balance sheet format.  I thought challenging the students to work out the math on the balance sheet would be fun.  I was wrong.  It came across as busy work and everyone was bored and actually frustrated that the numbers didn't tally (not every country was represented).

I now open the same ""lecture"" instead by pulling up the world population counter from census.gov.  As people walk into class, I simply let them observe the numbers climbing in real time.  It naturally prompts dialogue and questions.  Scrolling down on the website and picking out different graphs is an excellent way to get everyone genuinely interested in the topic and to actually ""teach"" through dialogue instead of flipping through slides.",The Summer Institute is simply fantastic.  Several of my colleagues attended this past year and I can already see how members are changing up their teaching and assessment strategies.

This is quite challenging for freshmen, but the students have a blast during the skit competition. The active learning activity breaks down barriers between students, and between the students and me. Students are more likely to talk with me, or ask and answer questions after the skits. (Wish I knew if the exercise improves student success.

In addition to student evaluations (that we tried to focus on student learning), we are doing two types of peer evaluation: 1) Senior faculty will be evaluated every other year, and junior faculty yearly, using a pretty standard teaching evaluation template. These evaluations will go to the college for promotion and tenure decisions, etc. 2) At the same time, faculty teaching will be assessed using a more rigorous template that focuses on active learning and evidence-based teaching. These evaluations will not be high-stakes, nor will they be used punitively; they will only be used to help receptive faculty improve their teaching.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,16,0,0

Some sessions are better are at getting students engaged than others but they all take a lot of preparation  You have to be in it for the ""long haul"".",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,15,0,0

Also within my department I am trying to have meaningful conversations re scientific teaching whenever possible.  With students, I am much more likely to ditch powerpoint slides in favor of an activity, usually having students count off so that they are experiencing new groups within the new semester.  I have noticed that more minority students are participating in leadership roles when the group size is reduced, compared to when the entire class is asked to participate in a round table discussion.","I have always found teaching ""scientific method"" a dreadful experience, as students feel they ""know"" it and despite trying to make it ""real"", it has always been flat.  This year, I borrowed a technique from a colleague to get students into groups, and then hand out index cards with different aspects of the method on the cards.  Then students were asked to either move around to get ""their"" card in the typical sequence of scientific method, or  (some of them did instead) to move the cards around on the table together, discussing it as they went. I could then visit each group, and ask questions about how they arranged things, and then let them decide what might work better in an efficient and effective scientific method.  It was FUN.  They were animated.  They argued. They laughed (especially the ones that were physically embodying their cards and shuffling around each other).  Then when I wanted to talk about some of the glitches in the system (why for example we often restart experiments or rerun them), they were more creative and attentive. Such a small thing, and yet such a long lasting result (I hope).","The Summer Institute came highly recommended to me from people I met at other scientific teaching workshops (much smaller in scale, and more like meetings than workshop actually).  When the date came around, I was ill (not contagious...just something chronic that flared that week), and I thought about not attending (even driving to the airport, I almost turned around several times).  However, I am so grateful that I went, and I learned so much.  I just thought you should know that someone who might have looked slightly disengaged (I was really not feeling well the entire time) was actually taking away so much, and is now a champion of the workshop.  It might be worth letting organizers and facilitators know that they should not take it personally if someone in their group seems ""not hooked"",  It might just be that they are really feeling poorly and they could be taking away MUCH more than can be imagined based on just their affect while at the SI.",1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,15,0,0

I don't have one specific one in mind, but I find the pace of the class works best with a little up front info, then questions that have student predicting what would happen next, or how the system would change when a particular part is missing, etc.  I find that 4-8 minute activities work best for me.  I use these in addition to shorter multiple choice questions that last 2-4 minutes before groups justify and discuss answers.","This one is ongoing...I train graduate teaching assistants to use scientific teaching when they are instructing laboratories.  I model scientific teaching in our weekly preparation meetings, but sometimes the approaches get ""modified"" by the TAs to make things ""easier"" for them an students (especially when they feel overwhelmed).  The TAs will sometimes simply give answers when students should be working them out themselves with the TAs acting as a guide.  I try to incorporate discussions of why the approach modeled in prep sessions is important for student learning and get them to fill in with their examples.  But I also try to listen to the TAs when they explain the challenges they are facing in the labs.  We have to work together to find the best, most effective approach for our students.  By making sure I have helped TAs address the teaching challenges they face, I feel like they are more likely to continue to use scientific teaching methods.  With new TAs every year, this is an ongoing challenge for me.","The Summer Institute helped me talk about what I always knew good teaching to be--it gave me a new lexicon and brought some ideas about student learning into focus.  I remember feeling like there were some people at the summer institutes that were giving some push back to the idea of scientific teaching--I didn't understand it then and I don't understand it now.  With our current technologies and resources, why would anyone want to be a talking texbook?  It seems obvious that we should do more with our students with the short time we see them in classes.  Anything less is a disservice to our students.",1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,14,1,1

It really helps to identify misconceptions. I also set up an ""entrance quiz"" for my class in the first week. The students get 100% points regardless how they did on the quiz, but it gives me an idea of what they do or do not know before they started.","I have been trying to incorporate more methods and data analysis in my senior class. It's a significant challenge, I think, largely because students have not been exposed to them previously. I find that repeating the same method in different context is an effective approach to teach them. There are significant amounts of reiterations before the students can master the concepts and learn how to analyze data. I wish they had been exposed to this process earlier in their education.","I entered the Summer Institute at Boulder after teaching a large undergraduate class for the first time in my life. What I learned was extremely useful in my later teaching practices, although implementing change has been very slow. Time has been the biggest limiting factor, the other major hurdle was to convince my co-instructors to change their practices. We discussed these factors at the Summer Institute, but it's different when you actually experience them. Another alarming trend I've experienced is that a significant fraction of my colleagues think that we do teaching innovations just because they sound good and please the administration. I admit that not all the changes I implemented in my class work, but the cloud of ""suspicion"" does not encourage anyone to do anything new. The administration cares about big changes, such as flipping the whole class. In reality, just incorporating active learning once a week significantly improves student engagement without redesigning the whole class. But changes like this do not get rewarded despite that they are effective.",1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,14,1,1

Because backgrounds varied so much, I tried making it collaborative and the peer-to-peer learning/teaching that went on was incredible.  They would have gone on for half an hour, had I allotted the time.  It worked very well again this semester and so it is now a staple for my advanced undergrad courses. I also did a collaborative ""pop-quiz"" which are more for attendance and review of material than actual evaluation-- students liked that too!","During the Snowpocalypse of 2015, students were totally stressed, angry and hostile (unlike anything I’ve seen in 20 years).  During a particularly sullen review session, I projected a Digital Maze game in class (many free ones available at MazeFire.com) and had students compete in small groups.  They immediately perked up and liked competing to be first to complete the maze, where they get to see how they did and get explanations for all of the in-maze questions.  I now use MazeFire games from time to time in my classes, for pre-tests, to generate discussion, for review and exam prep and to spark some more active and peer-to-peer learning.  The students play additional maze games back in the dorm room (often with classmates).","I was often ""not sure"" if I agree or disagree or felt it was half way in between, so that might be a useful answer option to include.

For example discussion of feedback in insulin and glucose metabolism. Majority of students have cars so it is easy to explain why during acceleration lots of fuel is pumped into the combustion system of the engine and removing foot from pedal cuts of fuel supply, just like lowering of glucose cuts of insulin after initial increased release from the pancreas increases glucose uptake by cells and the feedback regulates this process. The main theme here is chemical-energy in the form of fuel (glucose intake/metabolism by cells and gasoline combustion by the engine) both regulated and both generating energy that can be converted into work.","Adaptations of nature. For example why the female elephant genitalia is separated from the anus unlike other female mammals and how these aberrant is inextricably linked to our evolution. Elephants are so tall and big if their newborn come out of genitalia close to the anus during parturition, the newborn would not survive. Th question is how has nature tweaked it to have a successful outcome? so animals with tails, those without tails etc are not accidents but integral to the success of evolution. Such explanations show things we consider as complexities definitive are really simple in the larger sense.","The summer institute needs to be sustained and greater participation from institutions need to be encouraged. Apart from the active learning which is crucial to faculty enhancing their teaching skills, it is also refreshing and creates this unique platform where faculty from different institutions actually learn from each other, I do not know of any other place that this is done so well like the summer institute.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,12,0,0

As quantitative skills have been identified as critical skills for biology students, the Summer Institute should have an emphasis on teaching techniques for abstract thinking. This is important for instructors in non-math biology areas as well - unless most instructors for biology students embrace the importance of abstract thinking, students will never take it seriously. We know this from the fact that not many K-12 teachers emphasize importance of math to their students as they themselves are not comfortable. Consequently, not many students coming into college do not have much of abstract thinking skills.

After participating in the summer institute, I realized I could do more with less by making the quizzes collaborative and only giving them at key transition times in the course. I now give a quiz using IF-AT forms after each lecture chunk of the class (typically 2 weeks) and before transitioning to either a case study or paper to work on. Students take the quiz individually (without the IF-AT form) and then as a team (with the IF-AT form) just as was demonstrated at the Institute. It has worked great for 2 semesters now! Less grading for me and more metacognition for them.","It was a fantastic experience.
